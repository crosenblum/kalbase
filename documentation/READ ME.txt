I decided to make a very clean repack, just using int stuff. I based this repack on the client from 4th march 2010 and the pacd clean server files.
What I did was making the client working for private server, so I looked whats needed and whats useless for p-servers and can be deleted. 
Also I removed all the garbage and added descriptions whereever I was able to. Still there is some stuff thats not working, decide yourself what to do with it
(some monsters, items ..). The initmonster has int experience (1x) and there are not all monsters added. Check the macro for which mobs are in there, they
just need an initmonster entry to work. The spawns are taken from pacd repack, so the new ones are missing. Same for itemgroups.



small update list:

* g62 honor bow fixed
* g70 bow fixed
* mix effect fixed
* int mana med effect added
* new fort gate
* original indexes
